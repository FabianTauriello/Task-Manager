# The Brief:

My second Android application built with Kotlin. 

## Description

Task Manager allows users to create lists of tasks to manage their daily activities. At present, the application only allows users to add tasks and not delete them. Future iterations will add this feature (plus many others).

It makes use of the ViewModel architecture component and SharedPreferences to save data.

The project was built by following a tutorial from raywenderlich.com.
